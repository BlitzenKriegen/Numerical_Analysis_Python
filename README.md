# Numerical_Analysis_Python
The following is an implementation of various root-finding algorithms, as well as tools to analyze the methods. Included in the package are Four methods:
## Aitken's Method
Used as an accelerant for other methods
## Haley's Method
Used as one of the root finding algorithms. Implemented by me, with some code taken from Hatef Dastour.
## Bisection Method
Used as one of the root finding algorithms. Mostly implemented by Hatef Dastour, but the accelerated version is mostly completed by me.
## Newton's Method
Used as one of the root finding algorithms. Mostly implemented by Hatef Dastour, but the accelerated version is mostly completed by me.
